# Reflexion Agents

#### Reflexion  agent is different from [[Reflection Agent]] agent:

1. Reflexion has a **responder** node that generates an Initial response
2. This response has critique and search terms which are then searched for more relevant content
3. This response then goes into **Revisor**, which then generates another response which does more execution of tools(search) and then again goes into the **revisor**
4. This **revisor** loops until we have a satisfactory response(what is a satisfactory response???) 


## Code 

```python
from langgraph.graph import END, MessageGraph

MAX_ITERATIONS = 5
builder = MessageGraph()
builder.add_node("draft", first_responder.respond)
builder.add_node("execute_tools", execute_tools)
builder.add_node("revise", revisor.respond)
# draft -> execute_tools
builder.add_edge("draft", "execute_tools")
# execute_tools -> revise
builder.add_edge("execute_tools", "revise")

# Define looping logic:
def event_loop(state: List[BaseMessage]) -> str:
    # in our case, we'll just stop after N plans
    num_iterations = _get_num_iterations(state)
    if num_iterations > MAX_ITERATIONS:
        return END
    return "execute_tools"


# revise -> execute_tools OR end
builder.add_conditional_edges("revise", event_loop)
builder.set_entry_point("draft")
graph = builder.compile()


```

This agent can effectively use explicit reflections and web-based citations to improve the quality of the final response. It only pursues one fixed trajectory, however, so if it makes a misstep, that error can impact subsequent decisions.
